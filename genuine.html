<p style="font-family:chiller;">Hi there!!!!!<em>
WELCOME<em><br>I am gonna expound my feelings to you.Sooooo!!Once there,an essence found the right<br>
alternate to itself and it adored a soul.which is you.<br>
I find it had to explain how I AM DEEPLY INTO YOU!You had my heart a long long time ago and I've been trying to make desirable traits( which is right)
<br>It's been a tough thing mainly because i am a<em>BORN LONER<em>Meaning that(my natural self is very different from most)<br>
Though most take me as 'presumptuos',you were diff from them.Thanks for being that nice.<br>
Others say that 'out of sight out of mind',that thas not apply to me.<br>
since I left that school I realized that that "OMG I was Into You"It was very obvious<br>
NO day goes without your face flashing in my mind.I SOMETIMES LAY ON BED AT MIDNIGHT THINKING ABOUT YOU.<br>
I MISS YOU TOO MUCH.My dream has always  been-seeng you so that I will tell all about it<em>I LOVE YOU<em>
